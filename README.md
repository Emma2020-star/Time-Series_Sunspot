# Time-Series_Sunspot
Time series analysis of sunspot data from 1986 to October 2023
The relative sunspot number is an index of the activity of the entire visible disk of the Sun.
It is determined each day without reference to preceding days.
Each isolated cluster of sunspots is termed a sunspot group, 
and it may consist of one or a large number of distinct spots whose 
size can range from 10 or more square degrees of the solar surface down to
the limit of resolution (e.g., 1/25 square degree). 
The relative sunspot number is defined as
R = K (10g + s), where g is the number of sunspot groups 
and s is the total number of distinct spots. 
The scale factor K (usually less than unity) depends on the observer and is intended to effect the conversion to the scale originated by Wolf.
